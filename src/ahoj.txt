Creating the gardens was a monumental task. Large amounts of soil had to be shifted to level the ground, create parterres, build theOrangeryand dig out the fountains and Canal in places previously occupied solely by meadows and marshes. Trees were brought in from different regions of France. Thousands of men, sometimes even entire regiments, took part in this immense project.
